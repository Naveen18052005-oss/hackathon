4. (b)Examine the protocol data units of Ping and Traceroute commands in a protocol analyzer
Network Configuration Commands
This section outlines commonly used network configuration commands in Unix/Linux and Windows environments:

tcpdump / windump / Wireshark: Captures and analyzes network packets.
netstat: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
ifconfig / ipconfig: Configures and displays network interfaces.
nslookup: Queries DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
traceroute / tracert: Traces the route that packets take to reach a destination host.
Usage
Executing Commands:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Execute the desired network configuration command with appropriate options.
Interpreting Output:

Analyze the output of the command to obtain relevant network information.
Refer to documentation or online resources for command usage and interpretation.
Protocol Analysis
This section describes how to examine the protocol data units (PDUs) of Ping and Traceroute commands using a protocol analyzer:

Prepare Environment:

Install a protocol analyzer such as Wireshark or tcpdump.
Ensure administrative privileges or appropriate permissions for capturing network traffic.
Launch Protocol Analyzer:

Open the protocol analyzer application.
Start Capture:

Begin capturing packets on the network interface.
Execute Commands:

Execute Ping and Traceroute commands in a terminal or command prompt.
Analyze Captured Packets:

Stop the packet capture.
Filter captured packets to focus on Ping and Traceroute traffic.
Examine ICMP headers to view specific details such as ICMP type, code, and TTL values.
Interpret Results:

Interpret captured PDUs to understand the behavior of Ping and Traceroute commands.
Verify reachability and round-trip time (RTT) for Ping.
Analyze route path and hop-by-hop latency for Traceroute.
